# About Antz
Open Source Blockchain-Enabled B2B Service Procurement Marketplace

Welcome to Antz. We are a Singapore-based project that is seeking to build an open-source, blockchain-enabled B2B marketplace to directly connect buyers and sellers of business services. Antz is based on the Ethereum blockchain. We believe that by eliminating the use of intermediaries, our solution will help make procurement of services more cost-effective for buyers, will ensuring fair and equitable opportunities for suppliers. 

## What We Hope to Achieve
(1) Provide a direct connection between buyers and sellers of businesses services without a need for intermediaries.

(2) Build a robust and reliable open-source, permissions-free B2B platform for transactions.

(3) Leverage on blockchain technology for data exchange and creation/validation of smart contracts in transactions.

(4) Encourage innovation and collaboration where all participants are engaged in the development of the platform.
